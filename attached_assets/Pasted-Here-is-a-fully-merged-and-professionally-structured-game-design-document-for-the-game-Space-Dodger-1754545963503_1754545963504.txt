Here is a fully merged and professionally structured game design document for the game ‚ÄúSpace Dodger / Asteroid Avoider‚Äù, including all mechanics, difficulty scaling, power-ups, assets, and builder-style pseudocode ‚Äî ready to be pasted into a .doc or used as a development blueprint.

üéÆ Game Design Document
Game Title: Space Dodger / Asteroid Avoider

1. üéØ Game Overview
Genre:
Arcade / Action
Core Idea:
Control a spaceship to dodge falling asteroids. The game becomes progressively harder over time by increasing asteroid speed, frequency, and introducing more complex obstacles and power-ups.
Target Platform:
Web (built using JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS) or desktop (via Electron or NW.js)
Play Style:
Single-player, endless survival loop

2. üöÄ Game Mechanics
Core Mechanics
    ‚Ä¢ Player controls a spaceship horizontally (left/right).
    ‚Ä¢ Asteroids fall vertically from the top of the screen.
    ‚Ä¢ Player must dodge asteroids to survive.
    ‚Ä¢ The game ends on collision (or when lives reach zero).
Bonus Features
    ‚Ä¢ Power-ups: shield, slow motion, score booster.
    ‚Ä¢ Score multipliers for consecutive dodges.
    ‚Ä¢ Speed increases over time.
    ‚Ä¢ Randomized asteroid size, speed, and behavior.

3. üß† Game Progression & Difficulty
The game uses a progressive intensity system:
Time Survived
Difficulty Level
Game Changes
0‚Äì10 sec
1
Base spawn rate, slow asteroids
10‚Äì20 sec
2
Faster spawn rate, faster asteroids
20‚Äì30 sec
3
Bigger/faster asteroids, power-ups drop
30‚Äì50 sec
4
Special asteroids, limited power-ups
50+ sec
5+
High pressure, combo-based scoring

6. üß± Full Pseudocode Structure
Initialize Game
  - Set canvas size
  - Load images, audio, and game variables:
    - player_position = center bottom
    - asteroid_list = []
    - powerup_list = []
    - score = 0
    - lives = 3
    - game_time = 0
    - spawn_interval = 2.0
    - asteroid_speed = 100
    - difficulty_level = 1

Main Game Loop (runs every frame via requestAnimationFrame)
  - Update game_time
  - Handle Player Input:
    - LEFT arrow: move left
    - RIGHT arrow: move right

  - Update Difficulty:
    - Every 10 seconds:
      - difficulty_level += 1
      - spawn_interval = max(0.3, 2.0 - difficulty_level * 0.15)
      - asteroid_speed = min(400, 100 + difficulty_level * 20)
      - Introduce new asteroid types or power-ups

  - Spawn Asteroids:
    - If spawn_timer > spawn_interval:
      - Create new asteroid at random X
      - Set speed based on difficulty
      - Reset spawn_timer

  - Update Asteroids:
    - Move each asteroid down by (asteroid_speed * delta_time)
    - Check collision with player:
      - If collision and no shield:
        - lives -= 1
        - If lives == 0: trigger Game Over
      - If shield active: block damage and remove shield
    - Remove off-screen asteroids

  - Update Power-Ups:
    - Spawn rarely (based on difficulty)
    - If collected by player:
      - Activate effect (e.g., shield, slow time)

  - Update Score:
    - Increment based on survival time or dodged asteroids

  - Draw Everything:
    - Background
    - Player sprite
    - Asteroids and power-ups
    - Score and lives UI

  - Play Audio as needed

  - Loop continues with consistent framerate

Game Over State
  - Display final score, difficulty reached
  - Provide Restart or Quit option

7. ‚ú® Power-Up Effects (Optional)
Power-Up
Effect Description
Duration
Shield
Blocks one asteroid hit
Until used
Slow Time
Reduces all asteroid speed by 50%
5 seconds
Score Boost
Doubles points gained temporarily
10 seconds

8. üîÑ Adaptive Difficulty 
If player avoids 10 asteroids in a row:
  - Temporarily increase spawn rate

If player loses 2 lives quickly:
  - Slow down speed for 5 seconds
This ensures the game reacts to player performance, keeping the experience challenging but fair.
